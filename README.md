# e-Coins
Attempt to solve the e-Coins puzzle found at https://open.kattis.com/problems/ecoins.

This solution takes advantage of Euclid's formula to find possible pairs of X and Y such that sqrt(X^2 + Y^2) = S, where S corresponds to the e-modulus value in this specific problem.

The current version of this solution does pass testcase 1/3 but fails at testcase 2/3 with error: Time Limit Exceeded
